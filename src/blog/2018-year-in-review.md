2018 has been an amazing year for me. I **learnt** new things, **built** a few things, **wrote** a handful of blog posts and **met** some amazing devs in the community. But above all, I became a better dev by _learning and reflecting on my mistakes_ throughout. Here's a quick list down of how 2018 turned out to be an amazing year for me.

## Dev principles I picked up in 2018

I want to wrap up this post by highlighting a few dev principles I learnt and strictly adopted in my workflow in 2018.

- Code **without tests** is as good as **no code at all**
- **No** Abstraction **>** **Wrong** Abstraction
- Most optimization strategies you come up with will either result in **premature-optimization** or **over-optimization**. **Optimize only when absolutely necessary**.
- Have a broader vision of the problem/solution but break it down and build in **small portions** incrementally
- If you add a todo to improve later, you’ll never get back to it. So, **do it now**.

🥂 To another wonderful year full of opportunities and amazing people 🥂
