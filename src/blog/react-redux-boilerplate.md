_TL;DR: There's an amazing [React-Redux Boilerplate](https://github.com/flexdinesh/react-redux-boilerplate). This post is based on what I learnt from setting it up._

**React** has been quite the talk of the town lately and everyone wants to get their hands on it. After playing around with React for a few months now, I have to say, _React makes the whole web development process, a lot easier_. To know more about React, go through this article - [React taking over the front-end](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/yes-react-is-taking-over-front-end-development-the-question-is-why-40837af8ab76)

**Redux** on the other hand, is a _predictable state container_ for your React application. It helps abstracting and controlling the data flow in your application. It's quite an in-depth concept. To know more about Redux, go through this article - [Making sense of Redux
](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-redux-makes-sense-to-me-and-how-i-conceptualize-it-c8a3a9db15ca)

**Most of us, when we want to learn something new, or want to start a new project with a framework, we usually start scouting the internet looking for a reliable starter template/boilerplate setup with all the best practices.**

## The Original React Boilerplate

After messing around with React/Redux for quite some time I wanted to start my own React project. After a quick search, I found out this amazing [React Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate). If you've been a React dev for quite some time, you'd probably know about this boilerplate already. It was created by [Max Stoiber](https://twitter.com/mxstbr) and maintained by a battalion of amazing React Devs worldwide. But when I started out with the boilerplate I found it to be a bit over-engineered for a starter template. That's because the boilerplate was built to be production ready and **not developer friendly**. They say this right in their GitHub Readme

> Please note that this boilerplate is production-ready and not meant for beginners! If you're just starting out with react or redux, please refer to https://github.com/petehunt/react-howto instead. If you want a solid, battle-tested base to build your next product upon and have some experience with react, this is the perfect start for you.

## The Minimal React Boilerplate

So I spent quite some time and stripped down the original all-star React Boilerplate, removed all the _you-arent-gonna-need-it_ ([YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it)) stuff and created a **beginner friendly minimal boilerplate**. It has been setup with all the **best practices** and quite easy to quickly bootstrap a React based project. I find it very helpful personally and I think it might help a lot other React devs out there as well. Here's the link,

Feel free to fork/clone and play around if you must. And if you think there's space for improvement (there always is), do let me know, so we could fortify this boilerplate and make it even better.

You are amazing! Have a good day! ✨
