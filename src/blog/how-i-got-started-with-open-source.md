_TLDR: I started with documentation instead of waiting for some big idea to get started._

As most developers, I have also been wanting to get started with Open-Source for almost two years with no progress. I went through all star Open-Source GitHub accounts like [Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus), browsed through all the tweets and Twitter handles of great developers but was never able to figure out where to get started.

Then one day I saw this [git-flight-rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules) repo featured in GitHub explore of the week newsletter email. The repo seemed pretty new and it was around the same time when I was exploring a lot on how to use git effectively to improve productivity. The repo is a curation of frequently used git commands in the form of documentation. 

It started as _'Why not? Let's add what we learned to that repo'_.

I forked the repo and added a few topics on using `git stash` effectively and created a PR (Pull Request). The repo maintainer accepted the PR and sent a note of thanks for the contribution. The sense of satisfaction I got after that couldn't be put into words. I made a few more commits in the following days, and a few weeks later I became one of the **top 5 contributors** to the repo. The repo now has over **19k stars** and **1k forks** in GitHub.

So if you want to get started with Open-Source

- Don't wait for the perfect opportunity. Just pick something from your knowledge base and get started.
- What you contribute to doesn't matter as long as you get a sense of satisfaction in doing it. It doesn't necessarily have to be a ground-breaking ML algorithm, it can be as simple as a curated set of git commands too.
- Follow the GitHub explore of the week newsletter to keep tabs on interesting repos. 

Since then I have contributed to a few repos and have three npm packages under my belt. I'll be writing about the npm packages in the following posts.
